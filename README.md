# promptu-bar

A macOS menubar companion to [promptu](https://github.com/mrcnski/promptu):
compose LLM prompts from building blocks, from any app, no Emacs required.

Click the menubar icon (or tab to it), press block keys to build the prompt
while watching the live preview, then press `RET` — the composed prompt lands
on the clipboard, ready to paste into any agent.

## Blocks

Blocks are read from `~/.config/promptu/blocks.json`, the same file Emacs
promptu can load via `promptu-blocks-from-json`. Edit once, both frontends
update. The file is an array of objects mirroring promptu's block plists:

```json
[
  { "key": "r", "desc": "review", "text": "review your changes" },
  { "key": "i", "desc": "investigate", "text": "investigate {link}", "placeholders": ["link"] },
  { "key": "P", "desc": "push", "text": "push when done", "negative": "don't push" }
]
```

`{name}` placeholders are prompted for when the block is added. Blocks are
re-read on app restart.

## Keys

| Key       | Action                                    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| _block_   | Add that block to the prompt              |
| `-`       | The next block added is negated           |
| `⌫`       | Remove the last entry                     |
| `RET`     | Copy the composed prompt, close the panel |
| `ESC`     | Close the panel (prompt is kept)          |
| `⌘Q`      | Quit                                      |

## Build

```sh
make test      # run the core tests
make run       # run from the checkout
make app       # build dist/Promptu.app (ad-hoc signed)
make install   # copy it to /Applications
```

Requires macOS 14+ and a Swift 6 toolchain (Xcode 16+). To start at login:
System Settings → General → Login Items, add Promptu.

## Not (yet) ported from Emacs promptu

- History (`M-p` / `M-n` / `M-r`), undo/redo
- Point navigation and editing entries mid-prompt
- Whole-prompt free-text editing (`M-E`)
- Custom `promptu-separator` / negation prefix (fixed at `"\n- "` / `"don't "`)
- A global hotkey to summon the panel without touching the menubar
